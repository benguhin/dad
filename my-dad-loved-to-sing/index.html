            <br>
            <br>

            <p> I want to talk about musicals, as musical theater was a great source of joy for our dad.</p>

<p>Dad was constantly singing songs from musicals. He loved to sing. And he sang so, extremely... <i>loudly</i>. Consistently about twice as loud as he needed to, to the consternation of his wife and children and really anyone nearby with sensitive ears.</p>

<p>But he sang like he meant it. He is one of the most honest people I have ever met. He found the truth and told the truth and wasn&rsquo;t afraid if that might make people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It did, often, make people uncomfortable. Including his kids. Especially his kids. But it didn&rsquo;t even seem hard for him. When you talked to our father you got the honest version, every time.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this.</p>

<p>For example, M&amp;Ms were consistently purchased and then went missing in ways that suggested Dad did, actually, know what happened to the M&amp;Ms.</p>

<p>There was also an occasion when our family was staying at our Oma&rsquo;s house in Houston. Always eager to help with building things, our Dad spent the day working on projects to improve our grandmother&rsquo;s home during the day while our family went out to run errands for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Upon returning from errands, we noticed that the <i>dozen</i> peaches that we had left on Oma&rsquo;s kitchen table seemed to have disappeared. It was hard for us to imagine how so many peaches could be consumed in a single afternoon, and Dad was <i>oddly</i> silent as his mother in law, his wife, and multiple children began asking questions about where the peaches might have been moved to.</p>

<p>I remember Dad&rsquo;s silence continuing for a good minute or two, as Dad stood quietly with his eyes alternating between the ground and each of his individual questioners. Finally, he gestured that he was ready to speak, and said &ldquo;the peaches were eaten.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<br>

<p> For the things that mattered, our dad stood firm.</p>

<p>He was fiercely loyal to our mother, to his children, to his grandchildren. I always knew that on any day, anywhere in the world, I could call my father at 2am asking for help and he would be on his way as soon as he could get his shoes on.</p>

<p>We saw him walk out of mass when a priest was calling homosexuality a sin. We saw him furious at lies and hatred being supported by the political party that he had voted with for 36 years.</p>

<p>He believed in the goodness and decency of the country that he swore an oath to protect. The country that he served for 22 years, asking his family again and again to take up a new home in a new city and completely turn our lives around.</p>

<p>But we did it for him, and we would do it again.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>I miss him. I miss his steady force in a room. Sometimes this steadiness was because he fell asleep. But he was always so... chill.</p>

<p>And he was chill because he was so freaking happy that his dreams had come true.</p>

<p>He got to fly. He fell in love, he stayed in love. He had five extremely handsome children and a ballooning number of grandchildren who delighted in seeing their Pops.</p>

<p>He sang so loudly because he was living a life worth hearing out loud.</p>

<p>I'll love you forever dad. Rest in peace.</p>
